# NameMash by [superkojiman](https://gist.github.com/superkojiman)

NameMash is a Python script that generates a list of possible usernames from a person's first and last name. The script takes a file containing names as input and then processes each name to create different username combinations.

## Usage

To use NameMash, follow the instructions below:

1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your system.

2. Save the list of names in a text file, where each line contains a person's first and last name.

3. Run the script from the command line, providing the path to the names file as an argument.

```python3
$ python3 namemash.py names.txt
```

## Example

Suppose you have a file named `names.txt`, which contains the following names:

John Doe

Jane van Doe

Alice Smith



Running the script with this input will generate the following list of possible usernames:

johndoe

doejohn

john.doe

doe.john

doej

jdoe

djane

j.van.doe

d.jane

john

doe

jane

van
